## Motivation

Why use a note taking app at all?

Some history: I missed a security deposit to the electric company when I moved to Oklahoma because I had written it down on a Napkin while eating a Subway sandwich and they cut off power to my home!  The year was 2011 and I decided enough is enough, I need to get out of my own head and start using something ... anything ... that can help me keep my life on track.

I found Evernote, became a paid subscriber and did not look back. Life was good! Until ... the scewed up the search as time went on or maybe I took notice that their search wasn't very good as the number of notes increased beyod a thousand over a few years.

What it lacks, as of <u>now</u>:

If anything above is outdated and you cannot stand for it, please inform me immediately so I can get everything up to date.
