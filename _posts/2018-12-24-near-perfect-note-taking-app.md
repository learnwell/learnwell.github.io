If anything in this article is outdated and you cannot stand for it, please [inform me](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?screen_name=learnwell&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw) immediately so I can get everything up to date.

## Pro(s)

## Con(s)

What it lacks, as of <u>now</u>:
* Content from imported PDFs is not searchable. Not even typed content!
	* Given all their tech, this seems like an easy one to remedy and I hope they eventually pay attention to this.

## Background

<u>Question</u>: Why use a note taking app at all?

I missed a security deposit to the electric company when I moved to Oklahoma because I had written it down on a Napkin while eating a Subway sandwich and they cut off power to my home!  Enough was enough, the year was 2011 and I decided to get out of my own head and start using something ... anything ... that could help me keep my life on track.

I found Evernote, loved it and became a paid subscriber. Life was good! Until ... searching in Evernote started going bad and eventually just became downright unusable. As alternatives, gDocs and gDrive weren't much help either. My [angst](https://medium.com/@learnwell/evernote-vs-google-docs-the-user-loses-49b5eca7c052) is well documented.

Anyway, in 2018, I decided to take a sabbatical and go back to college for one semester, where I saw a fellow student using a super slick iPad and Apple Pencil with an equally awesome note taking app.

Sidebar: 6th generation 2018 iPad is the first affordable iPad to work with Apple Pencil. And it is a steal when purchased at Costco.

I did not know which app it was that I saw but after hours upon hours of research and multiple App Store purchases, I found it - [Notability](https://www.gingerlabs.com/)!

Later it turned out that it had awesome search and it even went on to fill the void in my life that was left by what Evernote and gDocs/gDrive lacked. I still drop its creators - Ginger Labs -  a feature request from time to time but for now they are near perfect and I hope they keep striving for perfection.
