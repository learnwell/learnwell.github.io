## Pro(s)

I can do everything that I used to do with Evernote and more!

I can **handwrite** and/or **type** notes from scratch.

I can handwrite and/or type <u>***on top of***</u> imported notes or PDFs with an added benefit of real-paper, touch & feel and no-lag response times with an iPad.

I can <u>**sync** with my mac</u>, where I prefer to type notes like I used to on Evernote.

Sure it stung at first to purchase from iOS app store for roughly 10 bucks and then again from mac app store ... BUT then I realized ... *HEY!* At least its not a subscription, rather it is a **one-time-cost** ... also its developers deserve the payment for their monumental efforts to bring this to life.</details>

I can use screen recording on iPad to create awesome tutorials as I talk and scribble on pre-prepared content. This can be then easily edited via `Splice` and placed on YouTube, at no added cost to me!

## Con(s)

What it lacks, as of <u>now</u>:
* Content from imported PDFs is not searchable. Not even typed content!
	* Given all their tech, this seems like an easy one to remedy and I hope they eventually pay attention to this.

## Background

<u>Question</u>: Why use a note taking app at all?

I missed a security deposit to the electric company when I moved to Oklahoma because I had written it down on a Napkin while eating a Subway sandwich and they cut off power to my home!  Enough was enough, the year was 2011 and I decided to get out of my own head and start using something ... anything ... that could help me keep my life on track.

I found Evernote, loved it and became a paid subscriber. Life was good! Until 2014 when I had over 1000 notes and searching in Evernote started going bad and eventually just became downright unusable. As alternatives, gDocs and gDrive weren't much help either. My [angst](https://medium.com/@learnwell/evernote-vs-google-docs-the-user-loses-49b5eca7c052) is well documented.

There were many *many* **many** <u>misguided</u> attempts to use StackEdit as a replacement for Evernote. I was hoping that if StackEdit markdown notes were saved in gDrive then they would be searchable too. ðŸ˜©What a huge time sink that research was to glue stuff together and I never got it to work. ðŸ˜­

Anyway, in 2018, I decided to take a sabbatical and go back to college for one semester, where I saw a fellow student using a super slick iPad and Apple Pencil with an equally awesome note taking app.

Sidebar: 6th generation 2018 iPad is the first affordable iPad to work with Apple Pencil. And it is a steal when purchased at Costco.

I did not know which app it was that I saw but after hours upon hours of research and multiple App Store purchases, I found it - [Notability](https://www.gingerlabs.com/)!

Later it turned out that it had awesome search and it even went on to fill the void in my life that was left by what Evernote and gDocs/gDrive lacked. I still drop its creators - Ginger Labs -  a feature request from time to time but for now they are near perfect and I hope they keep striving for perfection.
