##  IR Spectra Graphs
1. I often use [ChemInfo](http://www.cheminfo.org/Spectra/IR/Exercises/Browse_Spectra/index.html) to draw a compound for which I need and IR spectra graph.
2. Recently I wanted to modify the downloaded SVG file to use a yellow color instead of its usual red.
    * After some experimentation I figured out that replacing all occurrences of `rgba(251,19,19,1)` with `rgba(255,255,255,1)`  in a simple text editor, will do the job!
