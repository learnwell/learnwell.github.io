Training, here, refers to generating content to retrain oneself and/or others at a later point in time. This is good practice as it serves to keep one up-to-date and you don't feel like everyday work caused tunnel vision and loss of expertise in other domains that you once used to know.

In good humor I often abbreviate all three as [ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) which is probably a far less enjoyable domain.

This list was prepared (and is kept up-to-date) with the following goals in mind:
1. when looking for a training platform that allows me to create quizzes or lecture content that can allow rich content like developer-code to be present in it. Not to run but to display as part of the content, do you have this ability?

1. Moodle
    1. [www.moodlecloud.com](www.moodlecloud.com)
    2. [https://moodlecloud.com/app/en/portal/view/learnwell](https://moodlecloud.com/app/en/portal/view/learnwell)
        1. To login to the portal, your username is your site URL, and your password is your Moodle admin password
    3. GIFT format
        1. use a text editor to write multiple-choice, true-false, short answer, matching missing word and numerical questions in a simple format
        1. It was developed within the Moodle Community
        1. [https://docs.moodle.org/35/en/GIFT_format](https://docs.moodle.org/35/en/GIFT_format)
    4. [https://learnwell.moodlecloud.com/](https://learnwell.moodlecloud.com/)
2. Thinkific - [https://www.thinkific.com/tour/](https://www.thinkific.com/tour/)
    1. Manage who can enroll on your courses using Private and Hidden Courses

    1. Create & Enroll Users in a Course

    1. If you belong to the Business Plan ($99/moth) and above, Thinkific will automatically create your account at Accredible, and we cover the cost!
        1. You can make it even simpler for customers to redeem their offer by sending them to your course or bundle landing page via a URL where the discount will already be applied. All you need to do is add the following to the end of the normal URL for the page: **?coupon=CODE** 
3. Codio
    1. Apparently they entered the training platform + ready made VM game too!
        1. [Codio Guides](https://codio.com/docs/ide/tools/guides/), a rich content authoring tool for publishing content that allows students to view instructions while they edit their code.

            1. Allow you to write rich, multi section content using simple markdown. Itâ€™s incredibly easy.
           1. Not only can you structure your content into sections, but the Guide can automatically open and close code files as well as run terminal commands.
