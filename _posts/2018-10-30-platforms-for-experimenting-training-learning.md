Training, here, refers to generating content to retrain oneself and/or others at a later point in time. This is good practice as it serves to keep one up-to-date and you don't feel like everyday work caused tunnel vision and loss of expertise in other domains that you once used to know.

In good humor I often abbreviate all three as [ETL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load) which is probably a far less enjoyable domain.
