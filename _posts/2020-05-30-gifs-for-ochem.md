## Motivation

I’ve been thinking of making GIFs for ochem mechanisms but I wasn’t sure of the time investment. Today, I bit the bullet and after some research I found [ezgif](https://ezgif.com/). With simple drawings on an iPad with Apple Pencil and a few snapshots uploaded to the [ezgif](https://ezgif.com/) website ... it took 11 mins to produce something like this:

<img src="https://github.com/learnwell/learnwell.github.io/raw/master/assets/img/strecker%20synthesis%20condensation%20step1.gif"/>

I tried to draw a border and then copy/pasted it several times so that my hand drawn material wouldn't feel clunky but when I took snapshots to submit, I couldn't get the mall to be the same size!

BUT [ezgif](https://ezgif.com/) picked up on this nuance and auto-cropped all the images for me, how cool is that?
