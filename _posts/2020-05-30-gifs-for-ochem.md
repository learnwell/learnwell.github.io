## Motivation

I’ve been thinking of making GIFs for ochem mechanisms but I wasn’t sure of the time investment. Today, I bit the bullet and after some research I found [ezgif to do it and it took 11 mins to produce this .. wonder if its worth it to change the majority of our reaction log into something like this ...

## Solution

Type2Phone is the best in my opinion.

I evaluated 4 solutions:
Typeeto, Type2Phone, Mocha Keyboard, 1Keyboard

Typeeto, Type2Phone had the most recent developer releases which meant their developers were active and actually cared to update their stuff regularly, which was a good sign.

Additionally Type2Phone's **most recent** reviews were still rating it quite high so it wasn't going to be a throw away purchase (it doesn't have a `lite` version to try before buying).

I'm pretty happy with Type2Phone for now.
