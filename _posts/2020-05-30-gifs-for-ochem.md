## Motivation

I wanted to type directly from my macbook keyboard into [anki](https://learnwell.github.io/2020/02/14/anki.html){:target="_blank"} on my iPad so I could put together cards faster, while leaving the fancy iPad sketching to the apple pencil on my iPad.

## Solution

Type2Phone is the best in my opinion.

I evaluated 4 solutions:
Typeeto, Type2Phone, Mocha Keyboard, 1Keyboard

Typeeto, Type2Phone had the most recent developer releases which meant their developers were active and actually cared to update their stuff regularly, which was a good sign.

Additionally Type2Phone's **most recent** reviews were still rating it quite high so it wasn't going to be a throw away purchase (it doesn't have a `lite` version to try before buying).

I'm pretty happy with Type2Phone for now.
