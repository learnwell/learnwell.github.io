Although `pdfkit` docs make it seem like you always have to be the one to add a new page via `doc.addPage()` but that is not the case!

It actually does a good job of automatically letting the content overflow into the next page.

But in mature projects this little secret can get lost and folks often don't see the behavior I'm describing because of a small gotcha:
> Any (x,y) coordinate changes you make: `doc.text('line1',x,y)` ... will dictate the location of the next line, if its output without specifics: `doc.text('line2')`

Why would you even output a line without specifics? To take advantage of the auto-y layout and the overflow into the next page, ofcourse!
