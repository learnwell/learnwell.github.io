* 2020-04-14: After discovering `jekyll-crosspost-to-medium` I needed to find a quick way to ensure that there was a reasonable way to use it with the `type-on-strap` template that I host on `github pages` ... so I combined the fact that `_config.yml` file should mention it as a plugin and went looking on github for anyone who had possibly done this in a public repo:
    * `plugins crosspost filename:_config.yml`
    * [demo](https://github.com/search?q=plugins+crosspost+filename%3A_config.yml&type=Code)
