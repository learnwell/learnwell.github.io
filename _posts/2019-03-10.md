title: Saving to FireStore via AngularFire and TypeScript lacks polish

When working on a simplistic `save` operation for FireStore (Firebase's latest DB endeavor) I came across a rather obvious sounding yet perplexing error:

```
Function CollectionReference.add() requires its first argument to be of type object, but it was: a custom object
```

It was asking me to cast my `model` into an `object` which wasn't an unreasonable thing to ask but it felt very unpolished.

Isn't the whole point of writing typed code like this `private myCollection: AngularFirestoreCollection<SomeModel>;` in TypeScript is to be able to then use statements like `this.myCollection.add(someModelNewInstance);` and have them be implicitly understood.
