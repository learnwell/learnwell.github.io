title: Saving to FireStore via AngularFire and TypeScript lacks polish

When working on a simplistic `save` operation for FireStore (Firebase's latest DB endeavor) I came across a rather obvious sounding yet perplexing error:

```
Function CollectionReference.add() requires its first argument to be of type object, but it was: a custom object
```

It was asking me to cast my `model` into an `object` which wasn't an unreasonable thing to ask but it felt very unpolished as the whole point of writing code like this in TypeScript:

```
private myCollection:  AngularFirestoreCollection<SomeModel>;
```
