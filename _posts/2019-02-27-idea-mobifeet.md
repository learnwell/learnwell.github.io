### Problem Statement

1. Laptop feet with poor traction suck because they slip.
2.  Laptop feet with great traction are difficult to reposition.

MobiFeet allows users to turn a knob and easily reposition their laptops then turn again and sett them down for traction and stability.

It doesn't have to be a knob or a dial, the mechanism could be something much simpler that can be accessed while hands are still resting on keyboard and touchpad. Maybe via the thumb which can quickly reach the bottom edge of a trackpad where a hard-case shell could place the mechanism.
