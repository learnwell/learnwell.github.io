## Challenge

Focus into the input field inside a material-design-bootstrap modal

## Notes

* MDB means material-design-bootstrap
* The documentation for the modal used within this project is here:
	* https://mdbootstrap.com/legacy/angular/5.2.3/?page=advanced/modals#advancedUsage
		* Auto focus input in Modal ... did not understand this:
			* https://mdbootstrap.com/legacy/angular/5.2.3/?page=advanced/modals#buInput
	* Do NOT get confused by the latest docs which do not apply!
		* https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/angular/modals/events/
* mdbActive is important for moving label up and away from the text input
