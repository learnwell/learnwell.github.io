GitHub is an invaluable resource:
-   There are plenty of public projects that use loopback.
-   When in doubt, you can use code search to find syntax and other clues on how to perform certain tasks.
-   There are many ways to [narrow down](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-code/) search results, the keywords from an API search also apply to what you type in the searchbox on github: [https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#considerations-for-code-search](https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#considerations-for-code-search)
-   But keep in mind: Forked projects will not be searched by GitHub unless they have more STARS than their parent.
