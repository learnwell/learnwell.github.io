## Pocket versus Polar

I've used [Pocket](https://getpocket.com) (aka `getpocket`) since before I can remember! Its simple integration with devices like iPhone very early on like iPhone) made it my choice for bookmarking valuable articles that I was worried about forgetting or valuable blogs whose content might disappear from the web alltogether!

Yet today I've found [Polar]([https://getpolarized.io/](https://getpolarized.io/docs/anki-sync-for-spaced-repetition.html)) (aka getpolarized) which has the potential so be the next iteration private learning, retention and all around excellence. It even has a plugin to anki!
