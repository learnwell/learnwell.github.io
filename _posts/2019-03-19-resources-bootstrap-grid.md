## Motivation 

There aren't any online courses that provides a straightforward path for learning bootstrap grid. This is my attempt at putting the web's resources in a `roadmap` like order, which I would feel confident using and recommending to others.

## Roadmap

### Beginner

1. [1 min] In plain CSS terms, `display` property is where it all starts, `dispaly:flex` and `display:grid` are two mutually exclusive approaches to layouts.
	* Take a minute to think about that and google around if you need to adsorb this simple statement.
2. [10 mins] `fr` is the fundamental unit of a `grid` system. You should know how to use it: https://alligator.io/css/css-grid-layout-fr-unit/
	* We haven't jumped into bootstrap yet. This is plain CSS we are looking at.
3. Get acclimated with some bootstrap terminology, anyone can follow this. It won't prepare you for fluency but it will make everything stop looking like greek to you. Its really the best ic
4. [1 hour] [Understanding Bootstrap Grids and Columns](https://www.udemy.com/share/100p1oBEcceVpQ/)
	* Finally ready for Bootstrap Grid!
	* I cannot stress how quickly this FREE course helped me get over some of the simplest yet confusing questions that nobody was available to answer for me!
