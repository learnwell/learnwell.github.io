## Motivation 

There aren't any online courses that provides a straightforward path for learning bootstrap grid. This is my attempt at putting the web's resources in a `roadmap` like order, which I would feel confident using and recommending to others.

## Roadmap

1. [1 min] In plain CSS terms, `display` property is where it all starts, `dispaly:flex` and `display:grid` are two mutually exclusive approaches to layouts.
2. [10 mins] `fr` is the fundamental unit of a `grid` system. You should know how to use it: https://alligator.io/css/css-grid-layout-fr-unit/
