* Cannot zoom in to write words in between small gaps.
* Cannot add space between words, you can only insert a new line between them.
* Cannot write simple things like `8m/s` because the division symbol gets interpreted as a gesture or a character from the alphabet ðŸ˜©
* Cannot give titles to your own notes!!!
* Cannot cut and paste math formulas for easy reuse as templates as you progress with equations. Even if you wrote them yourself in nebo just one line ago in your note. Forget gestures there is no way to do it at all!
* Cannot import pdf files. This means you cannot bring in your scanned homework assignments to work on.
* Cannot insert any sort of space or indicate any separation between mathematical equations. They look like a run on sentence which greatly reduces their beauty and studentsâ€™ understanding.
* Export as Text is useless when math is involved.
* Export as HTML is poorly formatted when math is involved.
* Export as PDF is less than satisfactory when math is involved.
