## Motivation

Find the most mature and visually appealing libraries that offer drop-in components for creating <u>interactive directed graphs</u> within an Angular application.

## Notes

* Hands-on [practice](https://medium.com/netscape/visualizing-data-with-angular-and-d3-209dde784aeb)
  * With a [repo](https://github.com/lsharir/angular-d3-graph-example) that can be [launched on StackBlitz directly](https://stackblitz.com/github/lsharir/angular-d3-graph-example) successfully!
* [NGX Graph](https://swimlane.github.io/ngx-graph/)
	* Does not seem to be "interactive"
* [Rete](https://github.com/retejs/rete)
  * [Live Preview](https://codesandbox.io/embed/9jp88p1jpy?view=preview)
  * Seems to be geared towards a different goal than what we set out to achieve.
