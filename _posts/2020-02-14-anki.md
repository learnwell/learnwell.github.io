## Take notes via Apple Pencil

* Sometimes I would get lazy and wouldn't transfer all of my relevant notes to anki so I suffered when it came time to review and practice as the backlog of things to add kept increasing. Transferring images from notes taken in Notability or by hand was exciting at first but when I tried to scale it to match my study needs, it became a cumbersome process.
* Luckily there is a way to create handwritten notes directly on anki when using an iPad using apple pencil. I still type part of my question so that I have the benefit of text search but all the illustrations are done via apple pencil and automatically converted into byte sized images.
* Make sure to use this setting other wise you will face some annoying consequences: `⚙︎ > General > Drawing Screen Ignores Fingers`

## Take notes via Occlusion plugin

* The **Image Occlusion Enhanced** plugin by **glutamate** works very well.
* It is simplistic to create occluded cards via the anki client on macbook.
* And the usage on iOS devices for practicing via the occluded cards is excellent as well.
