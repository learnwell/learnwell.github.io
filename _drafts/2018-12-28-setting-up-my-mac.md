1. Tweak how history is maintained in by `terminal`
	* 
	* Full 
2. Get Chome
	* Remove touchpad gestures to avoid accidently navigating backward/forward within Chrome
		* Open `terminal` and run:
			```
			defaults write com.google.Chrome.plist AppleEnableSwipeNavigateWithScrolls -bool TRUE
			```
		* Credit for this solution goes to [OSXDaily](http://osxdaily.com/2015/05/09/disable-swipe-navigation-google-chrome-mac/)
3. *more to come*
