* Criteria for Filtered Decks:
  * Due within last 3 days
	  * `is:due prop:ivl<=3 -"tag:chem112" -flag:1 -flag:2`
  * Due within last 5 days
	  * `is:due prop:ivl<=5 -"tag:chem112" -flag:1 -flag:2`
  * To captures all the cards that were due within last 3 days while excluding any cards with the `chem112` tag. Also excludes things that have been flagged red/1 or orange/1 as I personally use them to indicate cards that seem completely wrong or need  improvements.
